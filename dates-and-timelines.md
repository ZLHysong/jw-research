# Dates and Timelines

This file contains all the information we can find about the various dates and timelines that the JWs have used in their publications. For the sake of being unbiased, this should include all major dates, with references to not only the JW publications, but also secular reports as well. I realize this can become quite an extensive list, but it is important to capture the big picture, and not just the facts we want to use to disprove the JW doctrine. 

Note (2020-08-13) - Some of the items listed below are the same, some overlap, and some seem obvious. This is intentional, as until I do the research, I don't want to assume anything and thus introduce flaws and mistakes.
