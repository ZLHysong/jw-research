# A White Man Learning in 2020 <small>(Or, How I found out that everything I was taught about history is wrong)</small>

> This is a memoir about how we institutionalize racism and sexism in America in ways that even white men might not know.

This is a sensitive topic, to be sure. It's one that must be approached with caution and care. But it is an important one. The whole concept of this came to me when I was watching Last Week Tonight's episode on US History. One of the main points was that even people who live in areas where tragedies have happened, like Tulsa, OK, have history taught in ways that make it out to be better than it was, or as if those things never happened.

This memoir is my journey of learning the truth about what actually happened, compared (with sources) to what we were / still are taught, and my thoughts on why. This will not only contain references to schools and universities, but also religions.

I was raised from infancy as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I was indoctrinated with many teachings that worked alongside the christian influenced school programs. Those two, working together, created a history and set of cultures in my mind that I never questioned until I was in my early 20s. But what if those teachings, the ones that said "After the Civil Rights Act, slavery and racism were gone!" were not true. What if there is something more sinister, more insidious actually happening? If you listen to most churches, especially Christian ones, they will likely tell you that any archaic textbook, other than the Bible, is full of misleading, intentionally false, apostate teachings and reasonings. Most Primary Schools in America will tell you that they are teaching you history in an unbiased, factual way. And they (Schools and Christian religions) often work together to present a complete picture of the past.

That history is wrong.

Sure, they get a lot of it right. Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream. He gave a speech about it. In the years that followed, there was some reform. But then... what? Then they trail off and suddenly it's 2020 and racism in America is no more! They won. The Blacks have their equality!

But, no. That simply isn't how it happened.

For example, how many of you reading this were taught that King was murdered in 1968 by James Earl Ray? I wasn't.

Why is this notable?

Because that omission also omits the guilt and the responsibility that Americans have for what followed. They want us to think everything is fine, and to move on to what they seems to percieve as more important things. They want us to ignore what we see around us and refuse to believe that such a thing as systemic racism might be not only possible, but prevalent.

And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

What follows is my journey. This is a history of what I was taught, compared to what actually happened.
